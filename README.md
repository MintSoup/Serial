# Serial
A nice little serial communicator written in java
<p>
So probably you've seen many programs used for serial communication and they're great and all, but all (or most of them) have these common flaws:
<br>Ugly UIs: All of the serial communication programs I know have REALLY ugly looking UIs
<br>Windows only: Not cross platform, so if you're used to it/used it on a friends computer or something and you like it, or just aren't running windows, this can be frustrating
<br>Sometimes hard to use: Some serial communicator programs just aren't really beginner friendly
<br> and maybe some more I didn't mention
</p>
<p>So, in order to adress all of these issues, I created my own serial program! It's written in java so it's cross-platform, it comes with an AWESOME default dark theme, but you can change themes or even create your own!
and, it's so easy to use my grandma could use it!!!!!(not really)<br>

# Building/Running
Clone the repo, and then open a termial/shell/command prompt/call it whatever you want in the root directory of the project. Next, type "gradlew run" if you're on windows, or "./gradlew run" if you're using powershell or on a unix system.
<br> If you want a jar version, use gradlew shadowJar (or ./gradlew shadowJar) and wait for the build to complete. Next, go to build/libs and you should have a jar file containing everything you need to run this program (Except JRE of course)<br>
